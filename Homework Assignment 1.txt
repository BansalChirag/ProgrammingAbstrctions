1. Write a C++ program to check whether a given number is a palindrome or not.

2. C++ program to print all the Repeated Numbers with Frequency in an Array.

3. WAP to print even numbers in a given range in reverse order.
Take the range from the user.

4. Write a program to calculate the sum of series up to n terms for a digit d.
n & d are taken as input from the user.
For example:
    Input: n = 5, d = 2
    Logic: 2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 
    Output: 24690

5. Write a program to find the digits which are absent in a given mobile number.
   For example: Input : 9354328855
                Output: 0167

6. WAP in program which accepts string from the user and
displays only those characters/elements which are present at an even index.
Example: 
    Input: "Python"
    Output: Pto

7. WAP to make an array of all the characters starting from character 'A'
to input charaacter from the user.
For e.g. Input: 'H'
        Output: ("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H")

8. Write a python program to find the intersection of elements from two arrays
(find the common elements in two lists).

9. WAP to reverse a given integer number.
Example: Input: 105320
        Output: 023501

10. WAP to concatenate elements of two arrays in the following order:
    a1 = ("Hello ", "World")
    a2 = ("Hi", "There")
    Output: ('Hello Hi', 'Hello There', 'World Hi', 'World There')
